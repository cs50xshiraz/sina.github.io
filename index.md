# Diabetes Insipidus(DI)

- Central DI(neurohypophyseal, neurogenic, pituitary, cranial) → Primary deficiency of AVP secretion
- Primary polydipsia → Suppression of AVP secretion by excessive intake of fluids
  - Dipsogenic DI → Excessive fluid intake appears to be caused by inappropriate thirst
  - Psychogenic polydipsia → Feature of psychosis or obsessive-compulsive disorder
  - Iatrogenic polydipsia → Increase in water intake motivated by a belief in its health benefits
- Gestational DI
  - AVP-D caused by increased rate of degradation by vasoperssinase produced in placenta
  - Usually remit several weeks after delivery
- Nephrogenic DI → Renal insensitivity to the antidiuretic action of AVP
  - Caused by drugs such as lithium, disorders such as hypokalemia, or genetic

## Arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) / Central DI

- Mostly acquired, autosomal dominant(< 5%)
- Due to inability of the neurohypophysis to synthesize and/or secrete AVP
  - Hypothalamic cell bodies, AVP axons, and posterior pituitary (< 10-15%)
  - Osmoreceptor dysfunction (adipsic AVP-D)
    - Neurohypophysis is intact, but no stimulation of AVP secretion → no polydipsia
    - Caused by head trauma or neurosurgery(clipping of aneurysm)

### Etiology

#### Acquired causes

- Neurosurgery → Mostly transient(98%), Na > 145 in first five postoperative days
  - Severed connection in neurohypophysis (triphasic response)
    - Polyuria for 3 to 6 days
    - Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) for 5 to 7 days
    - Re-Ployuria due to retrograde degeneration
- Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) → GCS < 13, usually transient, detected by MRI
- Autoimmune neurohypophysitis → 30-50% of nontraumatic AVP-D
  - Lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis (LINH), Immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related syndrome, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)
- Primary or secondary tumors
  - Intracranial germ cell tumors (IGCTs), rarely in pituitary adenomas & meningiomas
  - Secondary brain tumors (due to lung or breast cancer, leukemia, or lymphoma)
- Infiltrative diseases (such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis and sarcoidosis)
- Vascular disorders → 15% of patients with SAH, Ischemic disorders rarely cause AVP-D
- Infection → Acute bacterial meningitis, chronic tuberculous meningitis
- Hypoxic encephalopathy → Sheehan syndrome (postpartum hypopituitarism)
- Idiopathic AVP-D → Autoimmune neurohypophysitis may account for a large proportion
- Post–supraventricular tachycardia → Transient polyuria after correction of tachycardia
- Anorexia nervosa
- Drugs → Treatment with ipilimumab or discontinuation of vasopressin infused to treat hypotension

#### Genetic or congenital causes

- Familial AVP-D
  - Also called familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, or FNDI
  - Autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding AVP
- Wolfram syndrome
  - Also called DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness)
  - Caused by at least two different genes: WFS1 and CISD2
- Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) gene deficiency
  - Severe early malabsorptive diarrhea & undefined polyuria-polydipsia syndrome < 5 years old
- Congenital diseases
  - Congenital hypopituitarism
    - Symptomatic AVP-D, nocturia, reduced AVP release after osmotic challenge
    - Can be associated with isolated GH deficiency or multiple anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies
  - Septo-optic dysplasia(SOD) → Mostly sporadic
    - Midline & forebrain abnormalities as well as optic nerve & pituitary hypoplasia

### Postdiagnostic evaluation

- MRI without and with contrast
  - Except in patients with transient AVP-D due to neurosurgery or trauma
- ACE, AFP, Beta-HCG, TST or IGRA, IgG4, CXR or CT Scan

## Arginine vasopressin resistance (AVP-R) / Nephrogenic DI

- Decrease in urinary concentrating ability that results from resistance to arginine vasopressin
- Disruption of the AVP-stimulated signaling cascade in the principal cells of the kidney collecting duct
- Relatively common in old age, ill or kidney disease, significant AVP-R is a rare disease

### Etiology

#### Medication

- Lithium toxicity → Dysfunction of the aquaporin 2 (AQP2) water channel
- Cidofovir and foscarnet, Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, Amphotericin B, Demeclocycline, Ifosfamide, Ofloxacin, Orlistat, Didanosine

#### Metabolic

- Hypercalcemia → Ca concentration is persistently above 11 mg/dL
- Hypokalemia → Persistent severe hypokalemia (K concentration usually below 3 mEq/L)

#### Hereditary

- Vasopressin V2 receptor gene mutations (X-Linked)
- Aquaporin-2 gene mutation, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Bartter syndrome

## Clinical Manifestations

- Polyuria(U/O > 3 L/day), nocturia & polydipsia(due to elevation in sodium and osmolality)
- Neurologic symptoms related to the underlying disorder, such as diplopia and headache
- Psychological symptoms: increased anxiety, social isolation, and decreased quality of life
- May be exacerbated or become apparent during pregnancy due to increased catabolism of AVP

## Diagnosis

### Normonatremic patients

#### Establish the presence of a water diuresis

- Urine osmolality <300 mosmol/kg → Water diuresis
- Urine osmolality >600 mosmol/kg → Solute diuresis
- Urine osmolality 300 - 600 mosmol/kg
  - Total daily solute excretion is <1000 mosmol → Water diuresis

#### Establishing the presence of AVP-D (Water diuresis)

- DDx AVP-D, AVP-R and primary polydipsia

##### Plasma copeptin

- Baseline copeptin > 21.4 → AVP-R
- Baseline copeptin < 21.4
  - Water restriction test
    - Plasma copeptin < 3.8 → AVP-D
    - Plasma copeptin > 3.8 → Primary polydipsia
  - Arginine infusion test
    - Plasma copeptin < 4.9 → AVP-D
    - Plasma copeptin > 4.9 → Primary polydipsia

### Hypernatremic patients

##### Water restriction test via desmopersin

- Complete AVP-R → No elevation in urine osmolality, urine osmolality is <300 mosmol/kg
- Partial AVP-R → Up to 45% elevation in urine osmolality with level <300 mosmol/kg
- Complete AVP-D → A rise in urine osmolality of more than 100 percent
- Partial AVP-D → 15-50% increase in urine osmolality with level >300 mosmol/kg
